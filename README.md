## Project Overview 

Our objective is to predict hourly bike rentals to ensure supply can meet demand. 
<br>
In addition, we will investgate the following business problems: 

<ul> 
	<li>Is there a day of the week when bikes are rented more than others?</li>
	<li>Is there an hour when bikes are rented the most?</li>
	<li>Is there a season when bikes are rented more than others?</li>
	<li>Is there a temperature when the most bikes are rented? </li>
</ul>
